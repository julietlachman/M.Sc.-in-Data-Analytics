# Final Portfolio Project for MIS542 - Business Analytics

# No code used in project

Introduction
The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate a business analytics program of an organization with which there is prior familiarity.  Figure 11.1 and Table 11.1 (Nelson, 2018, Ch. 11, Efficient and Effective Analytics Programs section) will be the guideline for the foundation of the analysis.  

Summary
The data warehousing project on which this analysis is based is still underway.  There are some parallels between the project’s evolution in practice and preferred protocol from text and articles mentioned here.  While text and articles emphasize communication among project participants as a necessary attribute to analysis efforts - especially among groups whose efforts are necessary to further project’s progress, but whose proximity in organizational responsibilities may be farther apart, or seemingly not closely related - the project in play seems to lack consistent check-ins for progress as well as communication of changes in participants.  The lulls in communication create gaps in timeliness and knowledge transfers as well as needed updates regarding who has taken over tasks.  Also notable is the lack rallying for a data-driven culture.  
To improve overall progress, the following actions should be taken and added to future business analytic efforts:
Check-in with all project participants to reiterate scope of work, timelines, and goals;
Reintroduce teams and contacts
Update project status
Communicate findings of initial analyses
Present list of technologies –
Currently used
Previously attempted
Planned implementation 
Review / update governance
If the project management team would consider these actions, there might be a shift in, or renewed commitment to, the goals of more efficient quarter-end reporting efforts.
